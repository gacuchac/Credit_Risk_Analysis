# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm and then, using a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 
Next, we compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 
Finally, we evaluate the performance of these models and recommend on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
